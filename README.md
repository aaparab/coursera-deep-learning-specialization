# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization
---

My notes and solutions for the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/).

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)

Since the course policy forbids me from sharing my solutions, the quizzes and programming assignments are `gitignore`d. However I have documented good notes summarizing the contents from every week. You can find them here:

- [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](./notes_courses_1_2_3.md#course-1-neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

- [Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks](./notes_courses_1_2_3.md#course-2-improving-deep-neural-networks)

- [Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects](./notes_courses_1_2_3.md#course-3-structuring-machine-learning-projects)

- [Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks](./notes_course_4.md)

- Course 5: Sequence Models
