# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization
---

My notes and solutions for the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. Since the course policy forbids me from sharing my solutions, the quizzes and programming assignments are `gitignore`d. However I have documented good notes summarizing the contents from every week. You can find them here:

- [Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](./notes_courses_1_2_3.md)

- [Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks](./notes_courses_1_2_3.md#course-2-improving-deep-neural-networks)

- [Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects]

- [Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks](./notes_course_4.md)

- Course 5: Sequence Models
